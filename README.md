## Process for Git Merging:

- Go to merging branch and call `git fetch` to ensure branch is up to date with receiving branch.
- Ensure that HEAD is pointing to the correct merge-receiving branch; execute `git checkout <receiving branch>` (`git checkout master`)
- Make sure the receiving branch and the merging branch are up-to-date with the latest remote changes; execute `git pull` on the receiving (master) branch.
- Execute `git merge <branch name>` where 'branch name' is the merging branch.

## Process for Keeping Fork Up to Date:
- Fetch all remote repos and delete any deleted remote branches: `git fetch --all --prune`
- Switch to master branch: `git checkout master`
- Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repo's `master` branch: `git reset --hard <original repo>/master`
- Push changes to your forked repo: `git push <your repo> master`
